	"content": "Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. This helps ensure the secret can\u0026rsquo;t be compromised by someone examining your code, because the secret no longer exists in the code.\nOpen the AWS Secrets Manager service console\nChoose Store a new secret.\nOn the Choose secret type page, choose Credentials for RDS database.\nInput the User name (should be masteruser) Input your Password that you provided when you created the DB cluster previously. Next, in the Select which RDS database this secret will access section, choose the DB instance identifier you assigned to your instance (e.g. rdspg-fcj-labs). Click Next. Name the secret secretPostgresqlMasterUser and provide a relevant description for the secret, then click Next. Be sure to use the exact name (case-sensitive) of secretPostgresqlMasterUser to avoid having to edit some of the lab scripts later.\nFinally, in the Configure automatic rotation section, leave the option of Disable automatic rotation selected. In a production environment you will want to use database credentials that rotate automatically for additional security. Click Next.\nIn the Review section you have the ability to check the configuration parameters for your secret, before it gets created. Additionally, you can retrieve sample code in popular programming languages, so you can easily retrieve secrets into your application. Click Store at the bottom of the screen.\nOnce created, identify the ARN of the newly created secret. This value will be needed in subsequent labs. In the list of Secrets in the console, click on the name of the newly created secret.\n"
